## About
A simple random quote generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was built as part of the [JavaScript DOM Manipulation â€“ Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/5fb2aPlgoys) taught by CodeLab and hosted by freeCodeCamp. This project was created as part of my participation in the [#100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://github.com/ananfito/100-days-of-code).

## Status

This page is a complete, but I continue to make periodic updates to it as I learn more about web development and improve my skills. A live version of this project can be viewed at https://ananfito.github.io/random-quote-generator/.
